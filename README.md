I, like many others, was swept up in the NFT craze of 2021. I'd seen some collections of simple pixel art NFTs where they'd randomize a character's facial expressions, clothes, hats, appendages, etc. I spent a good chunk of time (far too much) thinking about what I could make that was interesting and permutable. It was late October or early November, Christmas was right around the corner and the idea finally came: Ugly Xmas Sweaters. 
The number of possible permutations of ugly xmas sweaters is infinite (or at least very large). They come in all different colors with whimsical designs, somehow festive and hideous simultaneously.
